We've long discussed a place to post writings from the Species File Group (SFG), here it is. We realize these types of things take time to make work, so we're going to take it slow, and see how it goes. We'll announce new posts on Twitter at [@sppfilegroup](https://twitter.com/sppfilegroup ).

We hope to include:
* Informal reflections
* Guest posts on biodiversity informatics
* Links (ping us!) to blog or podcast postings we think you'll find interesting
* Updates from [events](/events.html) such as TaxonWorks Together
* Occasional news on SFG projects

You might be asking, "why <em>propodeum</em>"? The term references a bit of anatomy found in some groups of Hymenopterans (the bees, wasps and ants). It turns out that as used the term is a homonym, i.e. it is used to refer to a structure that from the outside looks similar across species, but when examined closer can be shown to be be different. The spirit of this blog is to emulate the process that lead to the understanding of the nature of the propodeum, to write about things in an effort to tease out an understanding of their nature and diversity. And it sounds kind of hip and cool.
