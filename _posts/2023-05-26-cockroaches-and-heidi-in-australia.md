Researcher [Heidi Hopkins](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0961-4554), PhD, is a Blattodea specialist, with a particular research focus on  the family Corydiidae, many of which are desert cockroaches.  Working in both <a href="https://taxonworks.org">TaxonWorks</a> and Species File software, she curates data for the [Species File Group](https://speciesfilegroup.org/) in eight extant orders of insect, one extinct order of insect, and is building a catalog of the Isoptera. Her current research includes the identification of the Blattodea collection at [INHS](https://insect.inhs.illinois.edu/) and searching for new species amongst the _Arenivaga_ cockroach populations of Florida.

She recently received a grant of $6500 from [The Orthopterists' Society](https://orthsoc.org/) to spend a month in the natural history museums of Queensland, Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne and Darwin, Australia. There, she photographed all available Blattodea primary types for TaxonWorks, including this beauty from [Western Australia Museum](https://data.museum.wa.gov.au/dataset/terrestrial-zoology), Perth.

She also searched both the wet and dry collections of these museums for unidentified  specimens of [Corydiidae](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/ad049019-da30-43fc-9279-2e60447fc735), similar to the one pictured here, with the future goal of examining borrowed materials for new species.  The Australian Corydiidae have not been revised since 1968. This trip was completed in March, 2023.
